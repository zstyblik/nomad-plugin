<div>
    A comma delimited list of host_path:container_path strings to bind host<br>
    paths to container paths. Mounting host paths outside of the allocation<br>
    directory can be disabled on clients by setting the docker.volumes.enabled<br>
    option set to false. This will limit volumes to directories that exist<br>
    inside the allocation directory.
